1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Okay, now I can make this video without looking into the camera while I'm reading a script

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,520
on the side.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,520
And not just that.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,880
Ahora puedo hablar en español y nunca sabrás que esto es inglés e incluso en Hindi me

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,360
bien puedo hablar.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,560
And you will never know whether it's real or fake.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,040
Two AI apps that will make you question reality.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,840
Number one, Captions.ai.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,840
You just have to upload your video to Captions.ai and it will use AI to ensure that you're always

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
looking into the camera.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,960
It doesn't work if you look at extreme angles or close your eyelids.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
How would it look if I put my hand over it?

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
Is it that good?

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,240
Number two, HeyGen.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,800
You can just upload your footage here and then you can choose the language and boom,

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
done.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,960
To gaitemo, AI no shichio wa mitsuke nikui.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,400
Deepfake mo douyou.

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,440
Now HeyGen only lets you do 30 seconds of clip for free but it is so good that paying

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,000
for it wouldn't be a bad choice.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,640
However, these two AI sites will make you question reality.
